# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

**NOTE**: If you get aws-exports errors, please follow the instructions for setting up Amplify in the README in /test-app.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in non-interactive mode. Runs them once and it's done.

#### `npm run test:watch`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run test[:watch] -- <file>`

Runs the test runner but performs a filter for the filename specified. This is helpful for not running all tests, and instead just running a given file's tests.

**NOTE**: You do not need to specify the full file path. It uses a regular expression so it's easier to just think of it as providing a matching substring and it will run any files that contain that substring.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
